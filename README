General Information
-----------------------------------------------------
The contents of this file describe how to use the I Smell Something Funny packet analyzer.
I Smell Something Funny is a packet analyzer developed by Andon Mitsov as a course project for his 
Diploma za Sredno Specialno Obrazovanie. The application analyzes packets that travel through the specified network port
and prints the result in the applications' UI. It is an amatuer attempt to make something that works like Wireshark.
But it works(kinda).

Acknowledgmets
------------------------------------------------------
I would like to thank my course work advisor Lubomir Chorbadjiev for the help he has given me. 
I would also like to thank the tcpdump.org team for their effort in making the pcap library 
and the extensive documentationthey provide for it. Without them this application would be a 
lot harder to make.
